# Kava Testnet 11000

This testnet will be the largest public testnet in preparation for the `kava-5` mainnet release. If you are a kava mainnet validator, it is strongly encouraged that you participate, as this testnet will verify that various fixes for network performance have been effective. The testnet will run until mainnet launch (currently scheduled for March 4th).

Please put gentxs in the `gentxs` folder within this directory. Gentxs will be accepted until Saturday, Feb 20 at 15:00 UTC. The genesis file will be published on Saturday, Feb 20 at approximately 19:00 UTC.
